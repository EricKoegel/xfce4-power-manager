  <summary>Manage and reduce power consumption of computer and devices</summary>

  <description>
    <_p>Xfce power manager manages the power sources on the computer
    and the devices that can be controlled to reduce their power
    consumption (such as LCD brightness level, monitor sleep,
    CPU frequency scaling).
    </_p>
    <_p>In addition, Xfce power manager provides a set of freedesktop-compliant
    DBus interfaces to inform other applications about current power level
    so that they can adjust their power consumption, and it provides the inhibit
    interface which allows applications to prevent automatic sleep actions
    via the power manager; as an example, the operating system’s package manager
    should make use of this interface while it is performing update operations.
    </_p>
    <_p>Xfce power manager also provides two plugins for the Xfce panel,
    one to control LCD brightness levels and a second plugin to monitor battery
    and device charge levels.

      <description>
        <_p>This development release introduces a lot of new features, among them
        suspending/hibernation without systemd and UPower>=0.99. It allows for
        individual control of systemd-inhibition, a new panel plugin to monitor
        battery and device charge levels replaces the trayicon. The settings dialog
        has been completely restructured for better oversight and many open bugs
        have been fixed and translations have been updated.
