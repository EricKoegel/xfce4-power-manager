it is a separate program that uses xfconf to load/save settings with  respect  to  the  user  choice,

via DBus and gets information about which settings should be shown and  which  should  not,  for  example  the

running instance of the Xfce4 power manager.  \fBxfce4-power-manager-settings\fP doesnâ€™t  not  have  any  command  line option.
