1.3.0
=====
[Please note that this is a development release.]

Development release of xfce4-power-manager.
Please report all problems at bugzilla.xfce.org.

  This release has a large number of changes contributed by many
developers and translators.

  One of the most noticable changes to xfpm is a new panel plugin
to monitor battery and device charge levels which replaces the
trayicon. If anyone outside of Xfce was using xfce4-power-manager
in a different panel, such as LXDE, and wants xfpm to continue to
work there, request it in bugzilla and we'll work on it.

  The settings dialog has been completely restructured for better
oversight. Additionally, xfce4-power-information, a stand-alone
application has now been embedded inside the settings dialog.

  A new version of Upower, 0.99.0, breaks it's API compability
and xfpm required quite a bit of work to provide the same
functionality as previous versions of Upower. Concurrently,
several developers added support for systemd-logind in xfpm.
Xfce4-power-manager added a xfce4-pm-helper application to
suspend/hibernate on systems using upower 0.99.0 and higher.

  Jannis Pohlmann removed custom OSD brightness popup code and
it now uses libnotify so they can appear with any installed
notification daemon.

  Simon Steinbeiss created new icons for xfpm (based on the
Adwaita icon-theme) covering all the different device types
supported as well as all their individual states.

  Sonal Santan added support for keyboard backlight control.
This feature is useful when the firmware does not handle the
keyboard brightness control automatically.
