  <title>Introduction</title>
  The Xfce4 power manager is a part of the Xfce goodies project and features cpu frequency control,
  battery monitoring, monitor DPMS control, LCD brightness control, lid sleep and power buttons controls.
  All those features can be controlled from the user interface settings dialog.
  <sect2 id="xfpm-started">
  <title>Getting Started</title>
  <para>To launch the Power Manager you need to run the following command &app; -r which you can do from the xfce run
  command by pressing on ALT-F2, or by going to the Xfce settings manager and clicking on the Power Manager item -
  a popup will be displayed to run the power manger if it is not already running. 
  Once the power manager is launched for the first time, it will place an autostart desktop file in your .config/autostart
  in order to be able to be launched automatically each time you log into your Xfce desktop.

  <para>
  Almost all the &app; items are configurable from the configuration window, laptop users can set up 
  a power profile for two different modes “on battery power” and “on ac power”, desktop users still can change 
  DPMS settings and CPU frequency.
  </para>
  <para>
  The settings dialog differs from one system to another depending on the computer (PC,laptop,...) and on
  the available manageabale interfaces.  
  </para>

  In this section we will describe the possible configuration for the power manager.

	 Same as Ondemand but differs in behaviour in that it gracefully increases and decreases

NOTE:In &app; version &appversion; only Linux is supported for changing the CPU frequency.

	The user can select the his critical battery percentage, usually this is for a laptop or

	is 10% charged.    
   </para>
   <para>
   The user can define an action to be taken by the power manager in case the battery that is giving the main power
   for the computer reaches a critical charge level.

   The battery notification is a way to notify the user when the battery state changes ( ex: battery charge is full )

	DPMS is an old X extension that allows standby/suspend/turn off options of the monitor, usually the timeouts 
	have to be consecutive, so standby timeout is less than suspend timeout and so on, but any option can always
	be disabled.
	</para>
	<para>
	For laptop users, clicking on the checkbox allows the power manager to reduce the screen luminosity when
	it detects that system in running on battery power and increase it again when the system is running
	on AC power.

The "system tray" is an application running on a given X screen that can display small icons 
provided by running applications. In Xfce, it is a panel plugin that catches the icon and resizes it
to the size of the panel, if you don't have this plugin added to the panel you will not see any 
tray icon, for example pidgin places an icon in the system tray as well as many other applications.

&app; uses GtkStatusIcon to display the different kinds of batteries found in the system.

To notify the user about the status of the battery, serious errors occured, the notification daemon is used
to display such messages.

  <title>FAQ</title>
  <variablelist>

   <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: Why the icons look very similar to the icon of gnome power manager?</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: No, they are not similar, they are the same, just there is no point of re-drawing icons,
	gnome power manager icons are good enough. Not all of them are used.  
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	 <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: What is the difference between suspend and hibernate?</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: Suspend is a power save feature. When suspending, the computer is still using power,
	since the running applications are kept in the memory, but it is the lowest power level that the computer
	can use. While Hibernate saves the system state on the hard drive and turns off the power, when you start up your 
	computer	again those data will be loaded and the system back up. 
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	
	 <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: Why the options of suspend/hibernate are not there or I can not select them?</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: Many possible reasons, for example your kernel is not compiled with suspend/hibernate options.
	Another possible reason is the fact that you are not allowed to use them.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	
	 <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: How the power manager actually suspend or hibernate my system?</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: The power manager checks if the user is allowed to use power management service, then send a D-Bus message 
	to HAL asking to suspend/hibernate, usually the methods to suspend or hibernate used by HAL are scripts located in 
	/usr/lib/hal/scripts/YourOs.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	
	 <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: If the power manager puts the computer in hibernate because my battery charge is critical what will happen
	if I turn it on again without plugging my adapter?</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: Nothing actually, the power manager had taken the action defined by the user already.
	In the best cases, it will display a warning popup with different options.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	
	 <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: I select the option of the LCD brightness control but I do not see the brightness changing when I switch 
	from AC adapter to battery power?</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: Your kernel does not have the right driver, or the driver is not loaded.
	</para>
	</listitem>
