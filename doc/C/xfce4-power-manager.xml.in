  <title>Introduction</title>
 This software is a power manager for the Xfce desktop, Xfce power manager manages the power sources on the computer and the devices that can 
 be controlled to reduce their power consumption (such as LCD brightness level, monitor sleep, CPU frequency scaling). 
 In addition, xfce4-power-manager provides a set of freedesktop-compliant DBus interfaces to inform other applications about current power level so that 
 they can adjust their power consumption, and it provides the inhibit interface which allows applications to prevent automatic sleep actions via the power manager; 
 as an example, the operating systemâ€™s package manager should make use of this interface while it is performing update operations.
  
  <sect2 id="xfpm-started">
  
  <title>Getting Started</title>
  <para>If your distribution doesn't come with a default installation of &app; usually when you install it, it will be started next time you log into your Xfce desktop, 
  in order to start it manually you just need to run  the following command &app; from your terminal emulator, please not that running this &app; command 
  will cause the power manager to run in daemon mode, you can optionally add --no-daemon as a command line argument to disable this behaviour, 
  this can be useful if you want to see debugging outputs from your terminal emulator.
  </para>

 <sect2 id="xfmp-usage">
 <title>Usage</title>
 <para>
 The main idea behind a power manager is to control the power sources on mobile computers, such as laptops, on desktops or servers a power manager is basically less useful.

to dim the screen or switch off the monitor.

<note><para>If the inhibit option is selected and the computer is in idle for a long time the power manager will not put the system in suspend or hibernate, even
if it is enabled in the settings dialog, only critical actions are processed.</para></note>

Hidden options are the options that in normal situations one should not play with, but these options are provided in case of misbehaviour of the backend
the power manager is relying on.

Since &app; relies on xfconf to store and retreive configuration you can change any settings by using xfconf-query or by using your Xfce settings editor.

	"/xfce4-power-manager/change-brightness-on-key-events" is provided, just set this key to false if you have any problem related to this, please refer
    to the xfconf-query manual, but as an example you can disable this property by running the following command.
	 
	<programlisting>xfconf-query -c &app; -n -p "/&app;/change-brightness-on-key-events" -t bool -s false</programlisting>

&app; version &appversion; includes one panel plugin for LCD brightness control, possible other plugins might be added for future releases, the usage of the brightness plugin
is simple, just add the plugin to the panel same way you add any other plugin, then click on the plugin it will pop up a slider that you move/scroll on it to change
the brightness level of your screen, of course the plugin will not work on a system with no back light panel.

  <title>FAQ</title>
  <variablelist>

   <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: Why the icons look very similar to the icon of gnome power manager?</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: No, they are not similar, they are the same, just there is no point of re-drawing icons,
	gnome power manager icons are good enough. Not all the gnome power manager icons are used. please note that 
	for version &appversion; the icons are renamed to avoid possible conflicts with a gnome power manager installation.   
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	 <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: What is the difference between suspend and hibernate?</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: Suspend is a power save feature. When suspending, the computer is still using power,
	since the running applications are kept in the memory, but it is the lowest power level that the computer
	can use. While Hibernate saves the system state on the hard drive and turns off the power, when you start up your 
	computer	again those data will be loaded and the system back up. 
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	
	 <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: Why the options of suspend/hibernate are not there or I can not select them?</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: Many possible reasons, for example your kernel is not compiled with suspend/hibernate options.
	Another possible reason is the fact that you are not allowed to use them.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	
   <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: I had put my computer into suspend or hibernate mode, but the computer is not waking up.</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: This was subject for many bug reports, please note that the power manager has nothing to do with these problems, since the kernel
	is responsible of these tasks, the kernel team are puting a lot of efforts into fixing these kind of problems, if you still have troubles please
	report a bug to your distribution provider, they can contact the kernel team and possibly they can provide you a work-around.  
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>	
		
	 <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: If the power manager puts the computer in hibernate because my battery charge is critical what will happen
	if I turn it on again without plugging my adapter?</term>
	<listitem>
	<para>A: Nothing actually, the power manager had taken the action defined by the user already.
	In the best cases, it will display a warning pop up with different options.
	</para>
	</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	
	 <varlistentry>
	<term>Q: I'm not able to control my laptop brightness and/or my brightness pluing is reporting no device found.</term>
	<listitem>
	
	<para>A: One possible reason is the fact that the correct kernel driver is missing or doesn't exist for your laptop brightness panel, you can debug this fact by running this
	command:  
	<programlisting>lshal > output.txt</programlisting>
	then search in output.txt for "laptop_panel", if you don't find this key this means a driver problem, but in the other hand if you find it then come to us complaining.
