.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxfce4-power-manager\fP manages the power sources on the computer and the 
devices that can be controlled to reduce their power consumption (such as LCD 
brightness level, monitor sleep, CPU frequency scaling). In addition, 
\fBxfce4-power-manager\fP provides a set of freedesktop-compliant DBus 
interfaces to inform other applications about current power level so that 
they can adjust their power consumption, and it provides the inhibit 
interface which allows applications to prevent automatic sleep actions via 
the power manager; as an example, the operating system's package manager
should make use of this interface while it is performing update operations.
